About
       visualize  is  a  tool helping you to visualize C source code.
       What it basically does is to allow you to comment source code,
       add own folds or mark keywords with a label without changing the code
       itself. This is usefull for stable upstream codes that does not change
       often. This is not a tool for very rapidly changing  source codes.
       Rather  a  helper  to  annotate an important parts of a code,
       merge lines of code (even blocks) into new folds, that can be hidden
       or act as one semantical action.  E.g. code for initialization can be
       grouped into one fold and hidden (needed only when debugging some init
       probles for example). The aim is to show only those parts of code, that
       are essential for quick walkthrough of the code.

       Script is written in Python, using python-ply package.
